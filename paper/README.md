### 🔍 Summary

This paper introduces a novel return predictor for commodity futures called **basis-momentum**, which captures the difference in momentum between the first- and second-nearby futures contracts. The basis-momentum factor reflects the curvature of the term structure and provides enhanced return predictability.

### 📊 Key Contributions

- **New Factor**: Combines momentum and basis by measuring slope dynamics between nearby contracts.
- **Strong Predictability**: Outperforms traditional basis and momentum factors in explaining cross-sectional and time-series returns.
- **Economic Rationale**: Reflects trading frictions and constraints faced by speculators and arbitrageurs.
- **Robust Results**: Valid across commodity groups and time periods.

### 🧠 Implications

- **Academia**: Enhances understanding of commodity return dynamics through term structure-based factors.
- **Practitioners**: Useful for factor-based investment strategies and portfolio optimization in futures markets.
