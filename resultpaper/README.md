This repository contains the research paper:

> **"Enhancing Commodity Factor Strategies with Deep Learning: Evidence from Basis-Momentum"**  
> 📌 _Under review at the Journal of Portfolio Management (JPM)_

### 🔍 Summary

This study presents an advanced deep learning approach to improve the predictability of commodity factor-based strategies. It leverages both traditional financial factors and modern machine learning techniques to generate superior portfolio performance.

### 🧠 Key Highlights

- **Hybrid Factor Design**: Focuses on _basis-momentum_, a hybrid factor combining momentum and term structure signals.
- **Modeling Approach**: Applies LSTM and Transformer neural networks to rank 19 commodity futures dynamically.
- **Portfolio Construction**: Uses model-derived rankings to construct High4–Low4 long-short portfolios.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Demonstrates that deep learning-based strategies outperform traditional linear ranking systems in terms of return and risk-adjusted metrics.
- **Robustness Checks**: Conducts out-of-sample tests and model comparison against ARIMA and traditional factor sort methods.

### 💡 Research Contribution

This paper contributes to the growing literature at the intersection of **quantitative finance** and **deep learning**, offering practical tools for real-world factor investing in commodity markets.
